# Android App manages rules for users via SAMI 


TODO: rewrite the README

Build a remote light control system using SAMI, LED, Raspberry Pi, and an Android application. The system contains the following components:

 - An IoT device that acts on received commands, turn on/off the LED, and finally sends back the latest state.
 - An Android application that sends commands to the device and displays the latest state of the device.

Introduction
-------------

The tutorial [Your first IoT remote control system](https://developer.samsungsami.io/sami/tutorials/your-first-iot-control-system.html) at http://developer.samsungsami.io/ describes what the system does and how it is implemented.

This repository contains the following software:

 - An Android application running on the Android phone

Android Application
-------------

The root directory of the application is `sample-android-SAMIIoTSimpleController`.

Consult [set up the Android project](https://developer.samsungsami.io/sami/tutorials/your-first-iot-control-system.html#set-up-the-android-project) in the tutorial to learn the prerequisites and installation steps.
